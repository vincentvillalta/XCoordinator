///
/// In a `Transition` struct, transitions are defined by a `Transition.Perform` closure.
/// It further provides different context information such as `Transition.presentable` and `Transition.animation`.
/// You can create your own custom transitions using `Transition.init(presentable:animation:perform:)` or
/// use one of the many provided static functions to create the most common transitions.
///
/// - Note:
///     Transitions have a generic constraint to the rootViewController in use.
///     This leads to not all transitions being available in every coordinator.
///     Make sure to specify the `RootViewController` type of the `TransitionType` of your coordinator as precise as possible
///     to get all already available transitions.
